### Connection Steps

1. **Prepare Transistors**: Connect 1kΩ resistor to each transistor base
2. **Power Control**: Connect Q1 collector to key fob VCC, emitter to GND
3. **Lock Control**: Connect Q2 collector to lock button, emitter to key fob GND  
4. **Unlock Control**: Connect Q3 collector to unlock button, emitter to key fob GND
5. **ESP32 Connections**: Connect resistor ends to ESP32 pins 23, 19, 18
6. **Test**: Use multimeter to verify connections before powering on

### Alternative: Relay Module Option

For easier installation without key fob modification:

```
ESP32 Pin 23 → 12V Relay Module (Key Power)
ESP32 Pin 19 → 5V Relay Module (Lock Signal)  
ESP32 Pin 18 → 5V Relay Module (Unlock Signal)

Connect relay outputs to car's central locking wires
```

**Components for Relay Option:**
- 1x 12V Relay Module
- 2x 5V Relay Modules  
- Access to car's central locking wiring

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Initial Setup Phase**
```
Power On → Check EEPROM → No devices found → 30s Pairing Window
```

### 2. **Device Learning**
- ESP32 advertises as "ESPKV7 Tracker" (fitness device)
- iPhone connects via Bluetooth settings
- System extracts iPhone's IRK during secure pairing
- IRK stored in EEPROM with auto-generated device name
- System restarts for clean BLE initialization

### 3. **Operational Mode**
```
Power On → Load devices → 30s pairing window → Auto-restart → Keyless mode
```

### 4. **Proximity Detection**
- Continuous BLE scanning for known iPhone RPA (Resolvable Private Address)
- AES-128 encryption verification using stored IRKs
- Hysteresis filtering prevents false triggers from weak signals
- Automatic unlock when iPhone approaches (RSSI > -80dBm)
- Automatic lock when iPhone leaves (10s timeout + stabilization)

4. **Address Rotation**: Works with iPhone's automatic address randomization

### Code Architecture
```cpp
// Core Components
- Dynamic IRK extraction and storage
- Dual-mode BLE (Server for pairing, Scanner for detection)
- Automotive-grade proximity algorithms
- Reset-reason based state management
- Hardware watchdog integration
```

### Advanced Features
- **Hysteresis Filtering**: Prevents false triggers from signal fluctuations
- **Multi-device Support**: Handles multiple iPhones simultaneously  
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation if one device fails
- **Memory Management**: Efficient EEPROM usage with wear leveling
- **Power Management**: Optimized for automotive 12V systems

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- ✅ **IRK-based Authentication**: Uses Apple's BLE security framework
- ✅ **Fixed PIN**: Prevents unauthorized device addition (PIN: 123456)
- ✅ **Physical Access Required**: Device pairing requires physical presence
- ✅ **No Cloud Dependencies**: Fully offline operation
- ⚠️ **Production Hardening**: Consider additional security for commercial use

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"BLE scan parameter error 259"**
- Fixed by auto-restart mechanism
- Caused by ESP32 BLE stack mode transitions
